    "   Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in Rwanda are designed to address domestic private sector constraints such as; availability of industrial and commercial land, availability and the cost of energy, limited transport linkages, market access and availability of skills.\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "   The Kigali SEZ (KSEZ) was designated and developed to accommodate different types of industries including; heavy and light manufacturing industries, large scale users industrial plants, industries requiring excellent national/international communication network, industries requiring close links with other firms (those firms which produce component parts for the same product or those involved in separate stages of the same industrial process), wholesalers, chemical, pharmacy and plastics, warehousing, tourism and service industry and telecommunications among other services.\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "   Rwanda has strategic access to countries in the East and Central African region such as Kenya, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Burundi and is a catchment area of a consumer market of people reachable by road, barely four hours away from Kigali in all directions.\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "   It is also a member of a number of global and regional organizations and treaties of interest to potential investors such as the COMESA (The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa), which alone gives Rwanda access to a market size of over 500 million people in the region.\n",

    "   Therefore, to maximize the benefits from these markets in the region and around the world, the Rwandan Government established SEZs to enhance the country’s competitiveness as a commercial/logistics hub, taking advantage of her natural strategic location through the promotion of export oriented industrial activities as well as re-exports, manufacturing and services.\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "   Today, over 100 companies are already set up in the KSEZ, manufacturing made in Rwanda products from raw materials sourced from Rwanda, most of which are exported after.\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "   For example, we have Africa Improved Foods who make nutritious foods using soya, milk, maize among other products they buy from farmers, process it, and then export it. Last year, they exported goods worth an estimated US$ 30 million.\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "   The infrastructure in the SEZs enables us to attract companies such as Africa Improved Foods, which make big contributions to Rwanda’s exports.\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "   Therefore, industrial parks actually provide the infrastructure to make it faster for industries to take off and when they do, they allow a country like Rwanda to export processed products, which bring in more money in terms of their value compared to raw products.\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "   In terms of creating jobs, Rwanda has been creating new jobs every year and targets to create over 1.5 million jobs over the next seven years.\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "   To achieve this, industrialization is key. Almost 70% of Rwanda’s population is employed in agriculture, most of whom are youth and can easily be absorbed in basic manufacturing.\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "   A very good example is in garment manufacturing where a company like Pink Mango, C&amp;D Products Rwanda, also located in the KSEZ employs over 1,500 people. If we have 100 more businesses like Pink Mango, C&amp;D Products Rwanda in the SEZs, it would have industrial parks as the primary source of jobs.\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "   It is my hope therefore that after reading the companies in this KSEZ directory, you decide to invest in Rwanda or refer a friend. We are with you every step of the way.\n",
